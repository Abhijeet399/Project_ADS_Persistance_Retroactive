A Django web application that demonstrates a **retroactive banking system**, allowing you to create accounts, deposit, withdraw, transfer funds, and even **insert or delete operations retroactively** by timestamp.

> Built with: `Python`, `Django`, `HTML/CSS`

## Features

- Create multiple accounts with initial balances
- Deposit, Withdraw, and Transfer funds
- Add operations retroactively by specifying a timestamp
- Rollback specific operations based on timestamp and type
- View balances at any specific point in time (version/timestamp)
- Simple web interface with styled HTML forms

## Usage

python manage.py runserver


## Test Usecase

Perform the following steps via the web interface:

Create accounts:
    - Create siva with balance 120 at t0
    - Create msk with balance 520 at t1

Deposit to siva:
    - Deposit 120 to siva at t2

Withdraw from msk:
    - Withdraw 30 from msk at t3

Transfer:
    - Transfer 50 from msk to siva at t4

Retroactive Operation:
    - Withdraw 50 from siva at t2 (retroactively)

View Balance:
    - Go to View Balances and enter timestamp 2

You should see:
    - siva: 120 (initial) + 120 (deposit) - 50 (withdraw) = 190
    - msk: 520 (no change by t2) = 520

Rollback a specific operation:
Enter:
    - Timestamp: 2
    - Operation: withdraw

This will undo only the withdraw operation at t2 without touching future operations.
